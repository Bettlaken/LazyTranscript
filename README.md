### Description
LazyTranscript was developed in a master thesis and tries to simplify the transcription of audio and video material with the help of DeepSpeech and various plug-ins.
Through various plug-ins, the editor tries to reduce the effort required to correct the errors in the transcription generated by DeepSpeech.
